# My name is Brian Reisman ðŸ‘‹

- I am currently working my way through the full time full stack web development and computer science program at Lambda School. (Why Lambda School? It was the longest program I could find without going back to university.)

#### What projects are you working on on the side?
Two!

- Personally I'm working on turning the travel âœˆ calculator I have used to plan all 6 of my 1+ month long trips [backpacking Canada's Yukon Territory, SW + Montana (USA) road trip, Iceland (hiking + hitchhiking), Israel, eating and relaxing my way through Portugal, and bouncing around Spain] into an app so others can enjoy the benefits of it

- I am also working on a 9 person team building a job board specifically for Junior JavaScript developers. That's who we are and while we're scratching our own itch we thought lets build something that others will appreciate as well.

#### Are you learning anything on the side of Lambda?
Oh yes!

- I'm 30 hours into a top rated 40 hour course on React
- About 25% finish an algorithm and data structure series.
- And I am reading JavaScript: The definitive Guide cover to cover. (Currently on page 270 and learning how ES6 introduced dynamic imports!)
