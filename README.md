# Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Brian.  [![Linkedin](https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-blue?style=flat&logo=Linkedin&logoColor=white)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/brian-reisman/) 
I'm a full stack web developer <!--and certified SCRUM master--> with a background in theater and a passion for teamwork and learning. Looking to solve interesting problems with people who enjoy what they do.- I am currently finishing up the 6 month full-time full stack web development program at Lambda School that I'm treating like grad school. (Why Lambda? It was the longest program I could find without going back to university.)

<!-- #### What projects are you working on on the side?Two!-Personally I'm working on turning the travel âœˆ calculator I have used to plan all 6 of my 1+ month long trips [backpacking Canada's Yukon Territory, SW + Montana (USA) road trip, Iceland (hiking + hitchhiking), Israel, eating and relaxing my way through Portugal, and bouncing around Spain] into an app so others can enjoy the benefits of it - I am also working on a 9 person team building a job board specifically for Junior JavaScript developers. That's who we are and while we're scratching our own itch we thought lets build something that others will appreciate as well. -->

## What are you working on on the side?
- With a team of 9 I am building a junior JavaScript Developer job board with a focus on automation and scalability.

## What else?
- ðŸ“« Feel free to reach out. You can ðŸŽ™ðŸ’¬ Ask me anything at brianReisman@protonMail.com. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have spent a month (or longer) on 6 different trips (Iceland, Israel, Portugal, Canada's Yukon Territory, Spain, and trip around the SW of USA)

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with recreating React's useState in vanilla JavaScript. You can see my work on this up until now. The issue I'm facing is that index 0 that I get back is non-iterable data so I cannot spread state when updating state...
