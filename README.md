# My name is Brian Reisman ðŸ‘‹

- I am currently working my way through the full time full stack web developement and computer science program at Lambda School. (Why Lambda School? It was the longest program I could find without going back to university.)

### What projects are you working on on the side?
Two!
[x] Personally I'm working on turning the travel âœˆ calculator I have used to plan all 6 of my 1+ month long trips [backpacking Canada's Yukon Territory, SW + Montana (USA) roadtrip, Iceland (hiking + hitchhiking), Israel, eating and relaxing my way through Protugal, and bouncing around Spain] into an app so others can enjoy the benefits of it
[x] I am working on a 9 person team building a job board specifically for Junior JavaScript developers. We're scratching our own itch and we can't wait to offer it to other who we know will benefit from it.
