# Hello! ðŸ‘‹ My name is Brian.  
I do full stack web development, <!--and certified SCRUM master--> have a background in theater, and a passion for teamwork and learning. Since finishing my time at the longest full-time full stack bootcamp that I could find and treated it like grad school I have been working as a developer at [Xenith](https://www.xenith.com/) where I build pixel perfect UIs and make sure the site is meeting accessibility standards

- âš¡ Fun fact âœˆ: I have spent a month (or longer) on 6 different trips (Iceland, Israel, Portugal, Canada's Yukon Territory, Spain, and a trip around the SW of the USA)
