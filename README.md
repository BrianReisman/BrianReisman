- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on creating the same travel calculator, one using React and styled-components, and one using vanilla JavaScript and plain ol' CSS.

- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with recreating React's useState in vanilla JavaScript. You can see my work on this up until now. The issue I'm facing is that index 0 that I get back is non-iterable data so I cannot spread state when updating state...
