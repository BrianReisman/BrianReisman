# My name is Brian 👋

- I am currently finishing up my studies at the 6 month full-time full stack web development program at Lambda School that I'm treating like grad school. (Why Lambda? It was the longest program I could find without going back to university.)

<!-- #### What projects are you working on on the side?Two!-Personally I'm working on turning the travel ✈ calculator I have used to plan all 6 of my 1+ month long trips [backpacking Canada's Yukon Territory, SW + Montana (USA) road trip, Iceland (hiking + hitchhiking), Israel, eating and relaxing my way through Portugal, and bouncing around Spain] into an app so others can enjoy the benefits of it - I am also working on a 9 person team building a job board specifically for Junior JavaScript developers. That's who we are and while we're scratching our own itch we thought lets build something that others will appreciate as well. -->

## Are you learning anything on the side of Lambda?
Oh yes!

- I'm 30 hours into a top rated 40 hour course on React.
- About 25% finish an algorithm and data structure series.
- And I am reading JavaScript: The definitive Guide cover to cover. (I'm a bit of a JavaScript fanboy)

- 🤔 I’m looking for help with recreating React's useState in vanilla JavaScript. You can see my work on this up until now. The issue I'm facing is that index 0 that I get back is non-iterable data so I cannot spread state when updating state...
